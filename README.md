# PerlinNoise-JavaDemo

This is an implementation of the Perlin Noise algorithm in Java.

More specifically, this implements the algorithm in 2D, using the original version of the algorithm.  Around this implementation, a 2D map of noise values are generated and visualized using JavaFX.

The bulk of the work in this app takes place in the model package, specifically in ElevationMap and NoiseMaker.  All implementation of the actual Perlin Noise algorithm is in the NoiseMaker class.
